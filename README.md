# Food For All - A TechHearts project

Food For All is a platform to **quickly** connect NGOs, Foundations, Instituites and individuals to people especially (migrant labourers and daily wage workers) that require aid, supplies, survivial kits and most important FOOD.
The platform is to help out the less privileged people that are stranded, isolated, or in containment zones, are hungry and in need of basic humanatiaran help.

## Short DeProblem Statement : 

  **Problem Statement**
  _"If Covid doesn't kill you - Hunger will"_ That seems to be the heartbreaking reality for the millions of daily wage workers and migrant labourers who suddenly have no jobs and no source of income. If the most basic necessity - two square meals a day, are not met, they do not stand a chance for survival. This is the time that requires humankind to come together, united as one family, by caring for and providing for the lesser privileged sections of the society that have been the foundations of our daily comfortable life.
  It requires the coming together of NGOs, governments, industries, foundations and the common public, both in terms of funding and distribution management on the field to the needy.
  
 **Solution Overview**
 - In order to provide the right kind of aid to the right people at the right time, we need to have access to the right information. We plan to use various sources like news portals, government communications, volunteer alerts to get the real time information of migrants/daily-wage workers location, in-transit information, government quarantine institutes, containment zones and extract that information to get exact location coordinates where help is required. 
- This location information is then alerted to the nearest NGOs that have registered in the portal - who can choose to accept the call for help depending on their resource availability. 
- If it is a moving target, like in-transit migrant labourers, the system use tracking in real-time and predict where the targetted destination will be. 
- Specifically to solve the stale food issue seen recently, paging out is done in a controlled manner so that food can be prepared fresh and there will no wastage because there only the required number of NGOs are paged and there is no overlap.
- Our solution is a one-stop technical platform where we connect the NGOs to the exact location coordinates where help is required
